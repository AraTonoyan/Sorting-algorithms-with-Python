## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to arrange data in a specific order. They play a crucial role in various applications, from organizing databases to optimizing search algorithms.

## What are Sorting Algorithms?

Sorting algorithms are methods or routines that put elements of a list or array in a certain order. The goal is to rearrange the elements in ascending or descending order based on a comparison operator. Sorting algorithms vary in complexity, efficiency, and suitability for different types of data and problem sizes.

## List of Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Bucket Sort
Bucket Sort divides the array into a number of buckets, each capable of holding a range of elements. It then sorts each bucket individually using another sorting algorithm or recursively using Bucket Sort.

### Comb Sort
Comb Sort improves on Bubble Sort by using a gap sequence to eliminate small values near the end of the list, making it more efficient for large datasets.

### Gnome Sort
Gnome Sort is a sorting algorithm similar to Insertion Sort but works by moving elements one position at a time toward the beginning of the list.

### Heap Sort
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements in place.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort iterates through an array and repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, gradually building a sorted sublist.

### Merge Sort
Merge Sort divides the array into halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a sorted array.

### Quick Sort
Quick Sort chooses a "pivot" element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays according to the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

### Radix Sort
Radix Sort sorts numbers by processing individual digits. It sorts numbers by their least significant digit first and then moves to the more significant digits.

### Selection Sort
Selection Sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

### Shell Sort
Shell Sort improves on Insertion Sort by comparing elements separated by a gap, reducing the amount of data movement required to sort the elements efficiently.

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in Python and can be used for educational purposes, benchmarking, or integrating into larger projects. Explore the code, understand the algorithms, and see how they perform on different datasets.
